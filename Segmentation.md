### 논문에서 시사하는 바

According to these criteria, the task is partially solved. The first criterion, evaluating the segmentation at the pixel level, is fulfilled. At the occurrence level
(criteria 2 and 3), however, even the algorithms with the highest DSC output FP and FN regions. These errors are generally made in very difficult cases and
we should further evaluate their source, e.g. Figure 2c and 2d. Besides, there is still a lot of work to do on highly related tasks, including the segmentation of
lymph nodes, the development of super-annotator ground truth as well as the agreement of multiple annotators, and, finally, the prediction of patient outcome
following the tumor segmentation.

Following the analysis of poorly segmented cases, we identified several key elements that cause the algorithms to fail. ***These elements are as follows; low
FDG uptake on PET, primary tumor that looks like a lymph node, abnormal uptake in the tongue and tumor present at the border of the oropharynx region.***
Some examples are illustrated in Figure 1. ***Understanding these errors will lead to better methods and to a more targeted task for the next iteration of this challenge.***
